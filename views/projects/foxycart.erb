  <p class="project-description">FoxyCart is an ecommerce platform that allows you to sell any product on any website to any customer. But until version 2.0, the usability on tablets and mobile devices was not so great. I joined the FoxyCart team part time to help with developing the new version of the site, which is fully-responsive while still the ability to be easily customized. The entire development process was entirely collaborative, but I took the lead on both accessibility and performance, working to make the pages load as fast as physically possible on older devices and devices with limited connections, and making sure that the entire checkout process was accessible.</p>
