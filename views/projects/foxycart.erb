  <p class="project-description">FoxyCart is an e-commerce platform that allows you to sell any product on any website to any customer. But until version 2.0, the product's usability on tablets and mobile devices left something to be desired. I joined the FoxyCart team part time to help develop the new version of the site, which is fully responsive while remaining easily customizable. The development process was completely collaborative, but I took the lead to make sure pages loaded as fast as possible on both older devices and devices with limited connections, and I made certain that the entire checkout process was accessible.</p>
