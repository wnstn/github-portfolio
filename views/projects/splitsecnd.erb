  <p class="project-description">SplitSecnd is a hardware company that sells a safety device for cars that allows you to keep track of the mileage and location of your vehicles. They had a rudimentary member-administration system that was functional, but it wasnâ€™t all that pleasant to look at. So I was contracted to rebuild the admin tool. Their designer came up with a new design that made it easy for users to view recent data from their devices on a single screen. I built everything on custom JavaScript using Handlebars.js for templating and the Google Maps API for geolocation data. A second view allowed users to look at mileage data, with data visualization through Flot.js.</p>
