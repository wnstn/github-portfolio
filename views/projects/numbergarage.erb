  <p class="project-description">NumberGarage had a bit of a clunky signup form that was losing customers. I spent some time looking at the analytics for conversion drop-offs as well as reviewing the process for customers to get up and running. I then designed and built a new sign-up flow with better usability to help bring in more conversions.
