    <p class="project-description">Editorially was an awesome online collaboration and version control system for writers that needed a part-time QA engineer for the Javascript side of the app. I came on board part time to fulfill this function, exploring the innards of the javascript and writing tests to help guard against regressions.</p>

    <p class="project-description">FoxyCart is an ecommerce platform that allows you to sell any product on any website to any customer. But until version 2.0, the usability on tablets and mobile devices was not so great. I joined the FoxyCart team part time to help with developing the new version of the site, which is fully-responsive while still the ability to be easily customized. The entire development process was entirely collaborative, but I took the lead on both accessibility and performance, working to make the pages load as fast as physically possible on older devices and devices with limited connections, and making sure that the entire checkout process was accessible.</p>

    <p class="project-description">SplitSecnd is a hardware company selling a safety device for cars that allows you to keep track of the mileage and location of the vehicles you own. They had a rudimentary Member Admin system that was functional but not pleasant to look at or very user friendly. I was contracted to build out v2.0 of the admin, based on their designers plans. The new design made it easy for users to view recent data from their devices from one screen. Everything was built on custom javascript using handlebars.js for templating and the Google Maps API for geolocation data. A second view allowed users to look at mileage data and involved data presented with flot.js.</p>

    <p class="project-description">NumberGarage had a bit of a clunky signup form that was losing them customers. I spent some time looking at the analytics for conversion dropoffs and understanding the information required to get a new customer up and running. I then designed and built out a new flow for signups that will hopefully be more usable for customers and result in more conversions.</p>

    <p class="project-description">I had about two weeks to design and code this site. Thankfully, it wasn't from scratch, as we had a Node app written for Streamweaver we duplicated for the backend. But on the frontend, the only art direction I was given was in the form of app screenshots - after that I was given free reign. In two weeks I designed and coded a marketing index page, a Video#Show template, and the password reset pages.</p>

    <p class="project-description">Streamweaver is an iOS app that weaves together video from multiple iOS devices. After they launched, they realized they needed a way for users to share and watch videos via the web. I joined the team part-time to develop a website for that very purpose. The requirements were to move fast, I wrote a custom, client-side app that could be included once and used across all views. <a href="http://watch.streamweaver.com" target="_blank">Watch.streamweaver.com</a> isn't ideal, but it hit all the deadlines within the scope I was given. Right now, we're days away from a complete rewrite as a Node.js app.</p>

    <p class="project-description">Centresource is the preeminent Rails agency in Nashville, TN. I worked there for 2 years, doing front-end development. We used primarily SCSS, Coffeescript, and industry-standard practices for Rails front end dev. Towards the end of my time at centresource, I spent a week creating an internal tool for generating email signatures. I used class-based coffeescript to write a decoupled tool for taking in an input, and outputting email-friendly html, and then used CSS3/SCSS mixins to polish up the user-facing page. The result was a fun-to-use and very pragmatic tool for internal branding. </p>
