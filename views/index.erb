  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <h3>I'm Winston.</h3>

  <div class="copy">

    <p>I'm a Front End Developer, comfortable with working in a wide range of codebases
     using new and old tools. For specific experience, you can see my
      <a href="http://winstonhearn.com/resume" target="_blank">resume</a>.</p>

    <p>I love to work on diverse, small teams building software
      that in some small way improves people's lives. Because of that, I'm especially interested
      in accessibility, loading performance, and letting user's needs dictate design choices
      as opposed to developer convenience.</p>
