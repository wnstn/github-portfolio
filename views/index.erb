  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <h3>I'm Winston.</h3>

  <div class="copy">

    <p>I'm a Front End Developer, comfortable with working in a wide range of codebases
     using new and old tools. For specific experience, you can see my
      <a href="http://winstonhearn.com/resume" target="_blank">resume</a>.</p>

    <p>Recently, I helped build the <a href="http://press.fiftythree.com" target="_blank">FiftyThree Press Page</a>, worked as a QA engineer for <a href="http://editorially.com" target="_blank">Editorially</a> (RIP), and helped launch the fully-responsive, user-friendly 2.0 update to <a href="http://foxycart.com" target="_blank">FoxyCart</a>.</p>

    <p>I have experience with Ember.js, Angular.js, Javascript testing, Responsive Web Design, front-end performance, porting large CSS codebases to SASS, and improving the UX flow of forms and web apps.I love to work on diverse, small teams building software to improve people's lives. I'm currently fascinated with accessibility, loading performance, and letting users needs dictate design choices as opposed to developer convenience.</p>

    <p>My hourly rate is $80 and I'm available for part time work. If you are looking for a front-end developer, please email!</p>
