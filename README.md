Winston Hearn's Portfolio
==============

Hello Github, here's a good example of what I can knock out in an evening (well ok, the Sinatra app is something I originally setup for [here](http://ouradventure.in))

You'll have to forgive me - the app is definitely not optimized - the javascripts are not concatenated or minified, and there are two non-concatenated css files being loaded. Also, I just optimized the images for retina display without trying to decrease page size. There is only so much that can be done in an evening. Hopefully, this gives you a sense of my development skills.

Thanks for taking the time to visit this page, and any of my other portfolio pages. I really do appreciate it, even if I don't get a follow-up email or call or interview.
